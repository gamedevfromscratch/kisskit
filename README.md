The "Keep It Simple, Stupid" Toolkit, for game development in C

This project is just starting out; the intention is to create a game dev
toolkit suitable for both children and experts.

- written in C with GNU extensions
- extremely easy to use
- aiming for good quality code
- using SDL2 and Open GL for portability
- some example programs, for learning
- MIT Licensed, can be used freely in any project
- accept useful contributions from the community

The SDL test programs are loosely based on Lazy Foo' Productions Beginning Game
Programming v2.0, from http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/.

We are documenting our gamedev journey in our blog
(dev.to/gamedev)[https://dev.to/gamedev].

There are more examples including graphics demos and complete games in our main
[Game Dev From Scratch](https://github.com/gamedevfromscratch/gdfs) repository.

The convenience macros are inspired by:
- the wrapper functions in UNIX Network Programming by W. Richard Stevens,
- "Zed's Awesome Debug Macros" from
  http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex20.html.

Other ideas, not yet complete:
- brace and unbrace tools, to program in C with a lighter syntax, similar to
  Python.
