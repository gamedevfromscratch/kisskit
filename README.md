The "Keep It Simple, Stupid" Toolkit, for game development in C

This project is just starting out, the intention is to create an excellent game dev toolkit.

- written in C99 with GNU extensions
- extremely easy to use
- aiming for good quality code
- using SDL2 and Open GL for portability
- many example programs, for learning
- MIT Licensed, can be used freely in any project
- accept useful contributions from the community

The SDL test programs are loosely based on Lazy Foo' Productions Beginning Game Programming v2.0,
from http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/.

The convenience macros are inspired by:
- the wrapper functions in UNIX Network Programming by W. Richard Stevens,
- "Zed's Awesome Debug Macros" from http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/ex20.html.

Ideas not yet included:
- brace and unbrace tools, to program with a Python-like syntax.
- define TODO, FIXME and XXX macros, which show a debug message
